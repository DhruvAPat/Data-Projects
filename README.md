# Data Analyst Projects

This repository contains a collection of data analyst projects that I have worked on. Each project focuses on analyzing and deriving insights from different datasets related to various domains. Below is a brief description of the projects included in this repository:

## Flight Price Prediction

In this project, I have developed a machine learning model to predict flight prices. The dataset used for training and testing the model consists of historical flight data, including features such as departure and arrival airports, dates, airlines, and other relevant information. By analyzing this data and applying various regression techniques, I aimed to build an accurate predictive model that can assist in estimating flight prices for future bookings. The project includes data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation.

## Smart Watch Analysis

This project focuses on analyzing data collected from smartwatches. The dataset contains information about users' daily activities, such as steps taken, heart rate, sleep patterns, and exercise duration. The objective of this project is to gain insights into users' behavior and health patterns based on the collected data. By performing data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, and visualization techniques, I aimed to uncover patterns, trends, and correlations within the dataset, ultimately providing valuable insights for improving health and fitness tracking.

## Instagram Reach Analysis

In this project, I have explored the reach and engagement metrics of Instagram posts. The dataset comprises information about various Instagram posts, including the number of likes, comments, shares, and impressions. The goal of this analysis is to understand the factors that contribute to the reach and engagement of posts on Instagram. By performing data cleaning, visualizations, and statistical analysis, I aimed to identify the key elements that influence post reach and engagement, such as posting time, content type, hashtags, and captions.

Each project is contained within its respective folder in this repository, including the relevant datasets, code scripts, and any additional documentation required to reproduce or understand the analysis. Feel free to explore each project folder for more details.
